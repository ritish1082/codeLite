# CodeLite

A simple and lightweight online code editor that lets you run Python and JavaScript directly in your browser using WASM. No server, no database — just pure client-side execution.

## Motivation

After spending hours on LeetCode, I got curious about how these code editors are built and run. So, I decided to make my own version! This editor works entirely in your browser — no need for a server.

## Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JS

- Pyodide WASM

- Local Storage

## What's Next

- [] Add support for compiled languages like C/C++/Rust

- [] Enable online sharing with Yjs

- [] Create default templates for interviews, like CoderPad
